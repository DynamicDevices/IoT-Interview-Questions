I did a shout-out on Twitter for thoughts on good questions for junior IoT/embedded engineers and the answers have been hugely helpful and really made me think. So I thought I'd collate them here for  you. Pull Requests with your thoughts gratefully accepted! @embedded_iot

# IoT Interview Questions

## General Open Questions

- Talk about things they’ve done outside of education

- Something they’ve organised , or led, or been part of a team doing something.

- Talk about something they’ve done that they feel proud of,

- And a time when they’ve felt out of their comfort zone doing something

- Tell me about a project you did that you're most proud of, with as much detail as possible. Could be code related, could be whatever? (I've had people describe everything, from complex engineering projects to reorging a music festival. The ones who are REALLY excited to describe what they did in as much detail as possible. Grab those people. Give them interesting things to do and they'll never disappoint.)

## General Industry Awareness

- What is IoT, to you?

- What benefits have seen seen from Iot?

- What’s different about IoT compared to more general programming? What are the challenges and constraints?

- Where do you think <this company> / the state of the art will be with IoT in 3 years?

- What are the worst IoT or tech devices you've seen and how would you improve them

- What IoT device would you invent or most like to work on?

## Engineering

- Open-ended practical problem solving questions, eg: if we wanted to make <thing>, how could we design the setup and installation process for a non-technical user?

- Probe around the answers for things like accessibility, privacy, security, maintenance, lifecycle, etc.

## Teamwork

- A portfolio of their work on github , blogs, contributions.

- Examples of tackling interesting problems and I ask them what motivated them to approach the issue, and what hurdle did they encounter and what would they do different now.

## Software Experience

- What factors should you consider in an interrupt handler?

## Cloud Awareness

- IoT services offered by the main cloud providers and see which ones they know about and the use cases, etc.

## Communications Experience

- What tool do you recommend for passing messages around?

## Hardware Experience

- How would you choose a microcontroller for a design? What peripherals are needed?

- Can you solder ?

- Why is dew point important ?

- How can you verify that it will last 5 years on one battery ?

- How do you use an earth plane to improve EMC ?

## Security Awareness

- How would you ensure that the device is secure & cannot be used to compromise the users security?
  
- Discuss the OWASP IoT top 10 is a good place to start. It should help you gauge their understanding and interest in the topic
  
# Tests

## General
  
- Gve a 5 min prez with slides on a topic in the news… see how they research, summarise, make slides, present (See how much they care about the environment, circular economy, recycling, climate change, world politics, lol!)

## IoT
  
- Give them access to an installed sensor and ask them to write some code in [insert preferred language here] to produce a graph of its output over time in a front-end dashboard tool of their choice and give you a 5 minute presentation of what they've built?
